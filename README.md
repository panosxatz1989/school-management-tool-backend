This project may look simple but the urge to make it came after the private school my wife works, needed an application to manage lessons, curriculum and exchange messages
between students and teachers. This is only the backend which is (of course!) a REST API made in Spring Boot.

The only thing you need to do is to run maven command and boom!

This is not finished yet...
